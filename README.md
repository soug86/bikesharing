This written analysis contains three sections:

**1. Overview of the analysis**

**2. Results**

**3. Summary**
 
## 1. Overview of the analysis

The aim of the analysis was to setup a bike sharing business. Along with Kate, a dear friend, based on the wonderful bike trips taken together across New York, the intent is to understand how to make such a business successful in Des Moines, Iowa. Kate, has a potential angel investor who might be interested in providing seed funding for the business.

To convince the investor, there is a need to understand the nuances of the business and present the findings in a lucid manner. For the purposes of the analysis, bike sharing trip data at NewYork in the month of **August 2019** was downloaded and several insights were generated through the use of **Tableau**. The results were finally shared in a story format for Kate to build up into a powerful interactive presentation.

## 2. Results

The results primarily highlights the pvarious aspects of setting up a bike sharing business which would drive to the right decisions if a similar business is being setup in Des Moines. 

The key insights are as follows:
### **a. Checkout Times for Users:**

The first insight is to understand the average trip duration at different hours in the day. In the image above it is clear that the most of the rides were below **10 minutes** in duration and the number of rides reduce drastically in the early morning hours of 1AM-2AM meaning those will be good time to carry out bike maintenance. Kate can interactively select different hours of the day to walk throught he usage patterns as desired. The usage pattern will determine how many bikes would be needed in Des Moines.

### **b. Checkout Times by Gender:**

The second insight breaks up the earlier insight by gender category which tells us that men are more likely to avail of the services during late hours. Thus marketing and advertising for the new business can be targeted to the male demographics and also look at ways to attract more female customers.

The third insight is a heatmap to detmine the relative number of trips by each hour of the day. From the graph, it is evident thet most of the trips occur during office commute hours during weekdays to get in and out of work. On weekends, it is likely used as a recreational or leisure ride as most of the commutes are mid-day. Thus it needs to be evaluated if work commute in bikes would make sense in a city like Des Moines which might have much more relaxed parking and space constraints.
### **d. Trips by Gender:**

The fifth insight breaks up the number of trips by gender, weekday and user type. The user type is broken into long-term users **(Subscribers)** and impromptu customers **(Customers)**. The chart above tells us most of the use for the services are from loyal subscribers who use the bike services regularly through the week.

The sixth insight breaks up the users by gender and age by looking at the birth year of the users. From the cart above it is apparent that younger demographics **(Birth year between 1980-1995)** are more likely to avail of the services and serve as the core of the customer base. This should serve as vital info for the marketing and advertising teams to be more targeted in the messaging and also would be an important due diligence for the team to ensure that Des Moines's demographics are consistent with the target audience.

From the graph, it is apparent that the primary customer base is the male demographics that are subscribers who are passionate about riding bikes and use if very frequently for work and leisure commute. 

## 3. Summary

### a. **Summary from the analysis:**

The analysis provides various actionable insights and key decision points for due diligence on whether setting up a bike sharing business in Des Moines makes sense along the line of NYC. It is evident that the key customer base is the male demographics that are subscribers who are passionate about riding bikes and use if very frequently for work and leisure commute. Thus any advertising campaigns must be targeted to generate interest for this demographic while also look at ways to attract more customers for female demographics.

It would be an important due diligence for the team to ensure that Des Moines's demographics are similar to NYC's to ensure there is a big enough target customer base. It needs to be evaluated if work commute in bikes would make sense in a city like Des Moines which might have much more relaxed parking and space constraints.

### **b. Additional Visualizations:**

The two additional visualizations for further development are as follows:

Since bike maintenance and upkeep are a major ongoing cost for running the business addtional charts showing,

#### *i) Impact of number of bikes and its usage patterns.*
#### *ii) Impact of tripduration and location for each bike.*


will tell us the percentage of bike that are used more often than others and what kind of maintenance plans can be put in place or whether the bikes could be switched to ensure a more even usage.
